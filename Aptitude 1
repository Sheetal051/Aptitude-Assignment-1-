Q. The equations of the lines x=2 & y=4 meet at the point .............

Ans :
The equations of the lines x=2 and y=4 represent vertical and horizontal lines, respectively.
The line x=2 is a vertical line passing through all points where the x-coordinate is 2.
The line y=4 is a horizontal line passing through all points where the y-coordinate is 4.

These two lines intersect at the point where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Thus, the point of intersection is:
                      (x,y)=(2,4)

So, the equations of the lines x=2 and y=4 meet at the point (2,4).
