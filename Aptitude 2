 Q: Equations 2X+3Y=9 & 7X+9Y=-6 have how many solutions?

Ans:
To determine how many solutions the system of equations 2x+3y=9 and 7x+9y=−6 has, we can use the concept of linear dependence and the determinant of the coefficient matrix.
The system of equations is given by:
2x+3y=9
7x+9y=−6

The coefficient matrix is:
|2  3|
|7  9|

We need to find the determinant of this matrix to check if the lines are parallel, identical, or intersecting at a single point.

The determinant D of the coefficient matrix is calculated as follows:
    
D = |2 3|  =(2⋅9)−(3⋅7)=18−21=−3
    |7 9|

Since the determinant D is non-zero (D=−3), the coefficient matrix is invertible, indicating that the system of equations has a unique solution.
Therefore, the system of equations 2x+3y=9 and 7x+9y=−6 has exactly one solution.
