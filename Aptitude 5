Q: Income of A & B is in ratio 2:3. For example, if B’s income is Rs 3000, find out the ratio of their expenditures if their savings are Rs 500 & Rs 700,respectively
Ans:
To find the ratio of their expenditures, we need to determine the incomes and savings of both A and B, and then use this information to calculate their expenditures.
Given:
The ratio of incomes of A and B is 2:3.
If B’s income is Rs 3000.
Savings of A is Rs 500.
Savings of B is Rs 700.
First, let's find A's income. Since the ratio of A's income to B's income is 2:3 and B’s income is Rs 3000:
A ′sincome/B ′sincome = 2/3

Let A′sincome=x. Then:
  x/3000 = 2/3
Solving for x:
  x = 2/3 * 3000 = 2000
So, A's income is Rs 2000.

Next, we calculate the expenditures of A and B.
For A:
Income of A = Rs 2000
Savings of A = Rs 500
Expenditure of A = Income - Savings = 2000 - 500 = Rs 1500
For B:
Income of B = Rs 3000
Savings of B = Rs 700
Expenditure of B = Income - Savings = 3000 - 700 = Rs 2300

Finally, we find the ratio of their expenditures:
   ExpenditureofA / ExpenditureofB =1500/2300 = 15/23
Therefore, the ratio of their expenditures is 15:23.
